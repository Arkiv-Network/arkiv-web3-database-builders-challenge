## 4. Submission Requirements

All submissions must be made via the [official submission form](https://forms.arkiv.network/web3-db-challenge). This is the only valid method of submission.

All submissions must include:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **GitHub repository** | Public repo with open source license (MIT, Apache 2.0, or equivalent) |
| **Working demo** | Deployed and accessible via URL, connected to Arkiv testnet |
| **README** | Setup instructions, tech stack used, team members, and a brief description of your approach |
| **Submission form** | Completed official submission form with repo link, demo link, team info, and wallet address |

### What counts as a valid submission

- Must fall within one of the three approved verticals: **Job Board**, **Event Platform**, or **Knowledge Base**
- Must use Arkiv as the primary data layer
- Must be original work created during the Challenge period
- Pre-existing code (libraries, frameworks, boilerplate) is allowed, but the Arkiv integration and core application logic must be new
- Use of AI coding assistants (Copilot, Claude, etc.) is allowed and encouraged — we care about the result, not how you got there

### What will disqualify a submission

- Plagiarized or copied code from another participant
- Submissions that don't use Arkiv as the data layer
- Submissions outside the three approved verticals
- Malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities introduced intentionally

## 5. Prizes

| Place | Prize |
|-------|-------|
| 1st place | $2,500 USD (paid in USDC) |
| 2nd place | $2,500 USD (paid in USDC) |

**Total prize pool: $5,000 USD.**

### Prize conditions

- **Currency:** Stipend disbursed in USDC to the EVM wallet address provided by the winner.
- **The stipend is paid in lieu of self-organized travel and event admission.** Winners are responsible for arranging their own flights, accommodation, and EthCC tickets. The $2,500 is intended to cover these costs at the winner's discretion.
- **One prize per team.** If a winning team has multiple members, the team receives one stipend ($2,500). How the team splits the stipend is their responsibility.
- **KYC is required to claim the prize, not to enter.** All team members must complete KYC individually before funds are disbursed. The prize is sent to a single wallet address confirmed by all team members during the KYC process. See Section 7.
- **Prize is non-transferable** except as described in the runner-up policy (Section 6).
- **Tax obligations** are the winner's sole responsibility. The Organizer does not provide tax advice and will not withhold taxes.

---

## 6. Runner-Up Policy

If a winner cannot or does not claim their prize within **3 calendar days** of the winner announcement:

1. The Organizer will notify the winner and request confirmation
2. If no response or the winner declines, the Organizer may transfer the prize to the next highest-ranked submission
3. The runner-up then has 3 calendar days to complete KYC and claim the prize
4. This process may repeat at the Organizer's discretion

Reasons a winner may not claim include (but are not limited to): inability to complete KYC or failure to respond within the claim window.

If a winner claims the stipend but cannot attend EthCC, they keep the stipend.

---

## 7. KYC & Prize Disbursement

### Who must complete KYC

**All team members** of a winning team must complete KYC individually. This is required before any funds are disbursed.

### Required documents

Each team member must provide:

1. **Government-issued ID** — Passport (preferred) or national ID (photo page only). Signature must be visible on the ID.
2. **Signed declaration form** — A PDF form provided by the Organizer. Must be **printed, signed by hand** ("wet ink"), and scanned or photographed. Digital or pasted signatures are not accepted.
3. **Selfie with ID** — A photo of yourself holding your government ID next to your face

The declaration form will be available as a downloadable PDF linked from these rules and the submission form.

### Process

1. **Winner notified** via email and Telegram (provided in submission form)
2. **Demo video** — winner records a 2-3 minute demo (English or Spanish) and submits the link
3. **KYC submission** — all team members submit the three documents listed above within **3 calendar days** of notification
4. **Wallet confirmation** — all team members indicate the same EVM wallet address in their KYC form, confirming their consent to receive the prize at that address
5. **Verification** — the Organizer verifies documents (~2 business days). If documents are incomplete or incorrect, one correction round is allowed (2 additional days)
6. **Disbursement** — $2,500 USDC sent to the confirmed wallet address on Ethereum mainnet

### KYC data handling

- KYC documents are forwarded to the Organizer's compliance office for processing
- Government IDs and signed forms are retained per the Organizer's compliance requirements
- KYC data will not be shared with third parties except as required by law

## 8. Judging

### Panel

- Marcos — Arkiv, Product
- Seweryn — Arkiv, Platform
- Veronica — Builder, 1st Prize Winner - Arkiv Track @ Sub0 Hackathon 2025 BA

Ethereum Argentina is the Community Partner and does not participate in judging to maintain impartiality.

### Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria | Weight | What we're looking for |
|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Arkiv integration depth** | 40% | How meaningfully does the project use Arkiv's entity system? Proper schemas, queryable attributes, wallet ownership, TTL, entity relationships — not just a key-value wrapper. |
| **Functionality** | 30% | Does it work? Can a user complete the core flows for your vertical? Is it reliable? |
| **Design & UX** | 20% | Is it usable? Does it feel like a product someone would actually use? Does it abstract away blockchain complexity? |
| **Code quality & docs** | 10% | Clean code, good README, setup instructions, reasonable architecture |

All verticals are scored on the same rubric. See the [Builder's Guide](docs/builders-guide.md) for detailed examples of shallow vs. deep Arkiv integration.

### Process

1. All valid submissions are reviewed by the full judging panel
2. Each judge scores independently on all 4 criteria
3. Scores are averaged across judges
4. Final ranking is determined by weighted average score
5. In case of a tie, the panel discusses and reaches consensus
6. Judges' decisions are final and not subject to appeal
